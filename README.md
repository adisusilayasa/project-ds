# Data Science Project
Few project that i already done by implementing machine learning or deep learning. Mostly of the project is for my Research Paper.
### 1. Forecasting data donasi Mizan Amanah
This project was about forecasting the donation and zakat data. The data source from Mizan Amanah Donation. The purpose of the project is to forecast daily donation.
### 2. Forecasting Gudang Garam Stocks Using
This project was about forecasting PT Gudang Garam Stocks by implementing deep learning algorithm (LSTM). This project i used as research paper. Here I implement hyperparameter tuning to get best parameter to use in LSTM algorithm.  
### 3. Project-Car health Insurance
This project is intended to find out how interested old insurance customers are with the new insurance that will be issued by the company. The purpose of this project is to clasify customer interest with the new insurance product that the company try to create. In this project I did not implement hyperparameter tuning, but I use many machine learning algorithm and compare it and use the best performance machine learning by its gap between training accuracy and testing accuracy.
### 4. Water Potability Classification
This project is intended to find out how water is suitable for consumption or not by utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify based on several parameters.
